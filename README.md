### Features / What’s different:
- **List view** - a new collapsible panel showing daily notes in a hierarchical tree with:

    <p align="center">

    </p>

    - 6 grouping presets: Year, Year→Month, Year→Month Name, Year→Month #-Name, Year→Quarter, Year→Week

- Custom Titles for Daily Notes
    - Manually add/edit a custom title suffix per day (stored in plugin data, not file name)

    - Click the pencil icon on any day row to edit inline
- Color Tags
    - Right-click any day row or file to assign one of 8 colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, gray)

    - Colors display as a subtle background highlight
- Adds an optional title generation via `gemma3:4b`
    - When enabled, each daily note row in List view shows a small refresh icon to generate/update the title. Gnerates 3 keywords + 1-sentence description from note content
    - Uses your local Ollama server (default: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`)
    - Cached by file mtime (regenerates only when content changes)
    - Generated titles are stored in plugin data (it **does not rename files**)
- UI Enhancements
    - Zoom controls: Separate zoom sliders for calendar (default 130%) and list view (default 95%)
    - Remember view state: Optional persistence of displayed month, list open/closed state, and expanded groups across restarts
    - Responsive scaling: Calendar auto-scales in narrow sidebars

## Network & privacy
- Title generation is optional, and sends note text only to your **local Ollama** server (`http://127.0.0.1:11434` by default).
- The plugin itself only talks to that local endpoint. When you click **Pull** (or generate titles without the model present), your Ollama server will download `gemma3:4b` from its configured registry (internet) just like `ollama pull gemma3:4b` on the CLI.
- Disable title generation in settings to avoid any Ollama requests.
- Generated titles are cached per file mtime; content isn’t re-sent unless the note changes.
